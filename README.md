# Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation

This repository *will* offer implementation of our paper "Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation".

## To reviewers

We will release the following contents shortly:

- Model implementations based on the [facebookresearch/mae](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae).
- Code for pre-training and evaluation.

We hope our code to help further audio representation and application studies in the future. Thank you!
