# Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation

This repository *will* offer implementation of our paper "Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation".

## To reviewers

After the notification, we will prepare the following contents:

- Model implementations based on the [facebookresearch/mae](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae).
- Code for pre-training and evaluation.

Our code will use two evaluation benchmarks:
- [hear-eval-kit](https://github.com/neuralaudio/hear-eval-kit), evaluation kit for HEAR 2021 NeurIPS competition.
- [EVAR](https://github.com/nttcslab/eval-audio-repr), an evaluation package of audio representation.
